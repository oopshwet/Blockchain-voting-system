Blockchain-Based Hybrid Voting System

📌 Project Overview

This project is a secure, scalable, and transparent voting system that integrates blockchain technology, DigiYatra-based biometric authentication, and geofencing-enabled mobile voting to enhance voter verification, security, and participation.

🚀 Key Features

🛡️ Blockchain-Powered Security – Immutable vote storage ensuring transparency.

📍 Geofenced Mobile Voting – Smartphone-based voting within polling booths.

🤖 AI-Based Biometric Verification – DigiYatra-inspired identity authentication.

🖥️ Blockchain-Linked Smart EVMs – Secure voting for non-smartphone users.

🔍 Real-Time Fraud Detection – AI detects and prevents duplicate voting.

🔏 Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) & Homomorphic Encryption – Privacy-focused vote counting.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Blockchain: Ethereum / Hyperledger Fabric

AI & Machine Learning: Google Gemini API for facial recognition

Geofencing API: Location-restricted voting access

Smart Contracts: Secure and transparent vote recording

IBM Secure EVMs: Offline voting integration
